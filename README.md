# Countries

Countries is a web application that allows a user to select a country and display some
information about that country, including displaying the countryâ€™s flag.

The application is responsive, and the desktop version has an interactive world map that shows what countries were selected.
The user can also select a country on the world map to display information.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
